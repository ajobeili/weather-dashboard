## Weather Dashboard


### Desctiption

This is a weather app made using the OpenWeatherMap API and jQuery. Animations were created using HTML5 Canvas. Icons are from weather-icons.

I created this web app for Internship, I wanted to spend some time learning/using jQuery and HTML5. This is basically my first app, I got some help from www.github.com
